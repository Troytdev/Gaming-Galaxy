# Gaming-Galaxy
E-commerce Webpage Design Project (2015)

## Disclaimer

The objective of this project was to completely modify an HTML5 template. This project strictly focuses on positioning and design rather than functionality; however, the navigation bar functions as intended.

As a sample, I’ve provided a demo and screenshots of the pages for quick viewing. These Samples can be downloaded from the Samples folder.
